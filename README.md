# Graphql Subscription Study
I'm currently (04/2021) developing a software in my University (Uberl√¢ndia's Federal University), specifically in the Welding Lab. Currently I'm using Graphql in this project to learn and get to know this tool.

The project is a dashboard with some pages with lists and charts. Now, the project is almost ready but the final step for the first release is for it to be real time. At this point I'm used with resolvers, mutations and queries, I have a solid background in REST API but I don't have experience with WebSockets (unfortunately) and need to learn quickly to finish the project. 

So, I'll make a guide and write some thoughts to help future me and others to walk this path.
